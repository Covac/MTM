Use stem library
Edit torrc if possible
Experiment on more signals "saved png", DORMANT might be good if CPU usage is high
Look up limits on NEWSYN usage
Provide basic functionality, IN LIBRARY configuration for number "ports" of would be useful BUT might be sort of impossible
Easy integration to IndexBot's RequestManager and as proxy loading, as well as exposing number of possible concurrent connections and "IPs"

Write Config file in py
	- One will contain default paths for torrc file
	- In second one we will have options for torrc options we care about, aka no passwords, not now at least
Subprocess will reload these when we write new configuration in it
Be wary of windows and linux OS

Maybe have ready commands that will install needed tor service itself? Specially thinking about windows and its TOR expert bs?
Save old torrc with timestamp
